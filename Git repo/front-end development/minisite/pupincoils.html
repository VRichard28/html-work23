      Pupin coils Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called
      "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of the English
      physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's
      patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear
      when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &
      Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent,
      they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in
      hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging
      Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control
      of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly
      extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine
      ones.
