        1935)</strong>,also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. <br>

      <br> Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
      long-distance
      telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire
      (known as "pupinization"). <br>

      <br> Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which
      later
      became NASA.
